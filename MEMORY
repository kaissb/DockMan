## Container Operations - Sun Sep 28 01:09:17 AM EDT 2025
- Started implementing container listing functionality

## Container Listing - Sun Sep 28 01:11:43 AM EDT 2025
- Implemented backend API endpoint for container listing
- Created frontend UI for container listing

## Development Environment - Sun Sep 28 01:24:55 AM EDT 2025
- Updated Docker configuration for development
  - Set Go version to 1.24 in API Dockerfile
  - Improved web Dockerfile with better caching
  - Added Redis service for future caching needs
- Implemented dark mode support in the UI
- Set up proper networking between services
- Added environment variable configuration

## UI and API Fixed - Sun Sep 28 01:54:07 AM EDT 2025
- Resolved API server startup issues (port conflicts, syntax errors).
- Fixed SvelteKit configuration (vite.config.js, app.html) to resolve 404 errors.
- Implemented CORS middleware on the Go API to allow frontend connections.
- The application is now running, and the frontend successfully fetches and displays the container list from the API.

## Current Status
- Development environment is stable and running locally.
- API service is running and serving container data.
- Web frontend is connected to the API and displaying a list of containers.

## Docker Compose Fixed - Sun Sep 28 02:11:00 AM EDT 2025
- Resolved Dockerfile issues for both API and web services.
- Configured the API service to use `air` for live reloading within Docker.
- Fixed all port conflicts (`8080`, `6379`, `5173`) that were preventing services from starting.
- The entire application stack (API, web, Redis) is now running successfully via `docker-compose up`.

## Current Status
- Development environment is stable and running via Docker Compose.
- API service is running with live reload.
- Web frontend is connected to the API and displaying containers.

## Known Issues
- Dark mode has been implemented but requires full testing and verification.

## Project CRUD Implemented - Sun Sep 28 02:19:10 AM EDT 2025
- Implemented database layer using GORM and SQLite.
- Created `Project` data model.
- Built API endpoints for creating and listing projects.
- Developed a frontend UI to manage projects.
- Fixed all build issues related to cgo and the SQLite driver.

## Service CRUD Implemented - Sun Sep 28 02:34:18 AM EDT 2025
- Implemented `Environment` and `Service` data models.
- Built API endpoints for creating and listing environments and services.
- Developed a nested UI to manage the full Project -> Environment -> Service hierarchy.

## Interactive Terminal - Completed - Sun Sep 28 03:00:25 AM EDT 2025
- Implemented a backend WebSocket endpoint for interactive terminal access.
- Added a terminal UI to the frontend using xterm.js, connected to the WebSocket.
- Debugged and resolved multiple complex issues related to WebSocket connection and server-side rendering.

## Project Detail Page - Completed - Sun Sep 28 03:04:35 AM EDT 2025
- Created a `GET /api/projects/:id` endpoint to fetch a project with all its nested environments and services.
- Built a dynamic page at `/projects/[id]` to display the detailed project view.
- Refactored the main projects page to be a simple list that links to the new detail pages.

## Container Deletion - Completed - Sun Sep 28 03:09:05 AM EDT 2025
- Added a `DELETE /api/containers/:id` endpoint to the backend.
- Added a 'Delete' button with a confirmation dialog to the container list UI.

## Image Management - Completed - Sun Sep 28 03:20:04 AM EDT 2025
- Implemented API endpoints and UI for listing, pulling, and deleting Docker images.
- Added a safeguard to prevent the application from deleting its own images.

## Codebase Cleanup - Completed - Sun Sep 28 03:48:25 AM EDT 2025
- Updated the frontend Dockerfile to a more secure base image (node:20-alpine).
- Fixed all persistent SvelteKit type errors by correcting imports and adding explicit types.
- Built a robust, mock-based testing framework for the Go backend using an in-memory SQLite database.
- Added a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering all Docker API handlers.

## Copyright Headers - Completed - Sun Sep 28 03:51:57 AM EDT 2025
- Added a standard MIT License file to the project root.
- Added copyright headers to all Go, Svelte, JS, TS, CSS, Dockerfile, and YAML files.

## Unified Service Model & Live Monitoring - Completed - Sun Sep 28 12:51:15 AM EDT 2025
- Refactored the backend to use a unified, hierarchical 'Service' model for containers and Compose stacks.
- Implemented a service detail page to display sub-services for Compose projects.
- Added a live resource monitoring feature with WebSocket-powered charts for CPU and Memory usage on the container list page.
- Resolved numerous complex build and runtime errors across the stack, including Go version mismatches and frontend dependency/caching issues, to bring the application to a stable state.

## Environment Variable Management - Completed - Sun Sep 28 22:28:18 EDT 2025
- Implemented a secure system for managing environment variables, stored encrypted (AES-256) in the main database.
- Added full CRUD API endpoints and a frontend UI to add, view (with a show/hide toggle), and delete variables per environment.
- Diagnosed and resolved several complex backend issues related to encryption key size and Docker volume synchronization.

## Next Steps
1. Implement real-time container logs.
2. Add more detailed container operations (e.g., scaling, network management).
